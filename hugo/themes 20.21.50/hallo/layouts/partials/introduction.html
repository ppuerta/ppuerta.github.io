I work as a Data Analytics Manager at Paack, leading and mentoring a team of different Data Profiles, improving our data stack to be more data-driven by using advanced analytics, standing up big-data analytical tools, creating and maintaining models, and onboarding compelling new data sets.

I have over 10 years of experience working in analytics in different positions. Previously, I was a Senior BI Analyst at Wallapop, where I built from scratch the data stack helping the company to be able to improve the performance.
